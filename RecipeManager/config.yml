# As of version v2 the plugin generates books with recipes.

# When Shift+Clicking an item in the inventory while a furnace is opened, where should the item go ?

#   click - click type determines where the item should go, Shift+LeftClick to ingredient slot and Shift+RightClick to fuel slot.

# Multithreading allows server to do certain tasks in another thread (background) which would avoid freezing the server if it takes too long.
