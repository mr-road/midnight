# RecipeManager item and data aliases
#
# This file defines aliases for MATERIAL and DATA usable in recipe ingredients and results.
# You can use any names specified as values to replace MATERIAL or DATA.
# You can also use original names with custom data names or vice-versa.
#
# The first names of each material or data will also be used when this plugin prints item name/data.
#
# Examples:
#  dye:red    - valid: rose red dyes. (dye is material alias)
#  wood:birch - valid: birch wood planks (wood is original material name)
#  dye:5      - valid: purple dye (numeral data value acceptable)
#  wood:red   - invalid: will give an error since data value alias "red" isn't defined for material "wood".
#
# And of course when defining ingredients you can avoid the data value or use * to allow any data value.
#
# This file is great for giving easy-to-use names to items that are added by other plugins or server mods.
#
# You can add new aliases or edit existing if you like, see below examples or follow syntax:
#
# <material or id>:
#   names: <alias>, ...
#   <number>: <alias>, ...
#   ...
#
# If you don't want to give any data values, just aliases:
#
# <material or id>: <alias>, ...
#
# NOTE: You should split words by space or underscore when defining an alias, it will give you more matches, example:
# "smooth brick stairs" will be triggered when entering the same name or even "smoothbrickstairs", "smoothbrick_stairs" or "smooth_brickstairs".
