<h1>Recipe flags</h1>

<b>WHAT ARE FLAGS ?</b>
  Flags are the stuff that make a recipe very special! You can add various features to a recipe by using flags.
  For examples see <a href='advanced recipes.html'><b>advanced recipes.html</b></a>.

<b>USING FLAGS</b>
  Flags can be added in 3 'zones':
  - at the beginning of the file - which are copied to all recipes from that file
  - after recipe type (CRAFT, COMBINE, etc) - where they affect that specific recipe, you may even overwrite file flags for that specific recipe!
  - after recipe's individual results - to apply flags for the result items.

<b>ABOUT ARGUMENTS</b>
  Flags have arguments but not always are they all required.
  Arguments enclosed between &lt; and &gt; are required and those enclosed between [ and ] are optional.
  Some arguments may have 'or false', that means you can just type false in there to make it do something special (most likely disable the flag or a feature)

<b>ALIASES</b>
  They're just other names for the flag that you can use, they have no special effect if used, only for your preference.

    The &lt;number&gt; argument must be a number, by default it's seconds.
    The [suffix] argument defines what the &lt;number&gt; value is scaled in, values for suffix can be:
      s  = for seconds (default)
      m  = for minutes
      h  = for hours
    You can also use float values like '0.5m' to get 30 seconds.

      downfall = precipitation (rain/snow depends on biome).
      thunder  = precipitation + thundering.
    You can set more than one type separated by , character, but setting all of them is pointless.

  <b>@forpermission &lt;permission node&gt; @&lt;flag declaration&gt;</b>

    Adds other flags with permission requirements.
    You can specify this flag more than once to add more permissions or more flags to a permission.
    
    Basically this is a storage for flags and will only trigger them if the crafter has the required permission.
    This is useful for using different values for flags on the same recipe but for different permissions.
    
    The '&lt;permission node&gt;' argument must be a permission node.
    The '&lt;flag declaration&gt;' must be a flag that will work on the current recipe or result.
    For extra awesomeness you can even add this flag inside itself!
    
    NOTE: This will trigger all flags that player has permission for which means that flag effects will stack up.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @exp -2                      // you can use original flag as is for players that do not have the permission
      @forpermission farmer.newbs @exp 4   // add 4 exp to the original -2 exp so player will have +2 exp
      @forpermission farmer.uber @exp 50   // add 50 exp to the original -2 exp and also add 4 exp if the player has that node too
      @forpermission farmer.uber @level 1  // if has required  give the crafter 1 level

  <b>@permission [!]&lt;permission&gt;, [...] | [fail message]</b>

    Makes the recipe or item require the crafter to have a permission.
    Using this flag more than once will add more permissions, the player must have at least one to allow crafting.
    
    The '&lt;permission&gt;' argument must be a permission node, regardless if it exists or not.
    
    Adding ! character as prefix to individual permission nodes will do the opposite check, if crafter has permission it will not craft.
    
    You can also specify more permissions separated by , character.
    
    Optionally you can specify a failure message that will be used on the specific permission(s) defined.
    The messages can have the following variables:
      {permission}  = permission that was not found or was found and it's unallowed.
      {permissions}  = a comma separated list of the allowed or unallowed permission nodes.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @permission ranks.vip
      @permission !jobs.builder | &lt;red&gt;Builders can't use this!
      @permission jobs.farmer, jobs.trader | &lt;red&gt;You must be a farmer or trader!

    Checks for the light level.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    The first argument must be a number from 0 to 15 to set a minimum light level, or you can specify a number range separated - character.
    
    Optionally you can set the  [type] argument to specify light type:
      any    = (default) any kind of light.
      sun    = sun light only.
      blocks = light from blocks (torches, furnaces, etc) only.
    
    Be careful using blocks light level with furnace recipes as the furnace will provide light to itself.
    
    You can also overwrite the fail message or use 'false' to hide it.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous flag.
    
    Replace '&lt;block material&gt;' with a block material (not item!), see 'name index.html' for list, IDs up to 255 are blocks, after that they're items.
    Optionally you can define a data value which defines its skin, direction and other stuff, see the 'Minecraft Wiki / Data Values' link from the 'name index.html' file.
    You can also use aliases for materials and data values too.
    
    Additionally you can define a set of arguments separated by | character:

  <b>@ingredientcondition &lt;item&gt; | &lt;conditions&gt;</b>

    Adds conditions for individual ingredients like ranged data values, enchantments or using stacks.
    This flag can be called more than once to add more ingredients with conditions.
    
    The &lt;item&gt; argument must be an item that is in the recipe, 'material:data' format.
    If you're planning to add ranged data values the data value must be the wildcard '*' or not set at all in order to work.
    
    For &lt;conditions&gt; argument you must specify at least one condition.
    Conditions must be separated by | and can be specified in any order.
    Condition list:
    
      data &lt;[!][&amp;]num or min-max or all or vanilla or damaged or new&gt;, [...]
        Condition for data/damage/durability, as argument you can specify data values separated by , character.
        One number is required, you can add another number separated by - character to make a number range.
        Additionally instead of the number you can specify 'item:data' to use the named data value.
        Special data values:
          all: Flips the data check to allow all data values instead of none initially.
          vanilla: Only allow data values within the vanilla ranges.
          new: Equivalent to 0, or an undamaged item.
          damaged: On weapons and armor, this is everything within vanilla limits that is considered a damaged item.
        Prefixing with '&amp;' would make a bitwise operation on the data value.
        Prefixing with '!' would reverse the statement's meaning making it not work with the value specified.
        Optionally you can add more data conditions separated by ',' that the ingredient must match against one to proceed.

        A number can be used as level to set that level as requirement.
        You can also use 'max' to use the max supported level for that enchantment.
        Additionally a second number separated by - can be added to specify a level range, 'max' is also supported in ranged value.
        Prefixing with '!' would ban the level or level range.

      failmsg &lt;text&gt;                   = overwrite message sent to crafter when failing to provide required ingredient.
    
    This flag can be used on recipe results to determine a specific outcome for the recipe depending on the ingredients, however in that case you would need 'failmsg false' along with @displayresult flag too, see 'advanced recipes.html' file for example.
    
    NOTE: this flag can not be used in recipe header, needs to be defined on individual results or recipes.

  <b>@forchance &lt;chance&gt;% [^]@&lt;flag declaration&gt;</b>

    Triggers other flags or groups of flags by specified chance.
    Using this flag more than once will add more flags.
    
    The 'group' argument defines a group for the flags (not permission related), can be any combination of letters only, no spaces either.
    Grouping flags makes the system pick only one flag from the bunch which means it's also limited to 100% total chance.
    If a group is not defined then the flags will be added to the default group which is a special group that will trigger flags randomly according to their chance, it can trigger all at once or even none at all.
    
    The 'chance' argument suggests a chance value that can be between 0.01 and 100 and the '%' suffix is required.
    The chance argument is only optional if there's a group defined, then the remaining chance will be evenly split between all flags with undefined chance.
    
    The 'flag declaration' is a flag like you'd add a flag to a recipe or result, you can even add this flag into itself to make multi-chance structures.
    The flag declaration argument is only optional if there's a group defined and will act as literally nothing.
    Optionally you can prefix the flag declaration with the '^' character to append the data from the flag to the previous flag of the same type from the same group (no group is still a group, but a special one).
    
    NOTE: If using '^' prefix, always use '^' and '@' together like '^@', no space in between.
    NOTE: In a group there must be at least a chance value or a flag declaration.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

  <b>@individualresults</b>

    Allows multi-result recipes to have individual result outcomes, instead of a chance based outcome between all results.
    With this flag set, the first valid recipe found will be the one crafted
    
    A percent chance on a result will cause the recipe to fail the rest of the percent out of 100.

  <b>@failmessage [message or false]</b>

    Changes the message when recipe fails due to failure chance.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous message.
    
    The message supports colors (&lt;red&gt;, &amp;3, etc).
    
    You can also use the following variables inside the message:
      {failchance}    = recipe's chance of failure as a number.
      {successchance} = recipe's chance of success as a number.
      {resultchance}  = result's chance of success as a number.
    
    The same effect can be achieved by using @message on the fail result item.
    
    Allows quotes to prevent spaces being trimmed.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @failmessage &lt;red&gt;YOU FAILED, MWaHahahah!

  <b>@addtobook &lt;book id&gt; [volume &lt;num&gt;]</b>

    This flag is a shortcut for quickly adding recipe(s) to books.
    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous one.
    
    The book must exist first, you must create it, see 'recipe books.html' for how to do that.
    
    The '&lt;book id&gt;' argument must be an existing book's ID/filename, case insensitive.
    Optionally you can specify which volume to add it to, otherwise it will be added in its 'recipes' node and left to be added automatically to the latest volume with free slots.
    
    NOTE: To properly remove recipes from books you must first remove this flag (to avoid re-adding them) then go to the book's YML file and remove them from there as well.

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @addtobook testing book // matches a 'Testing Book.yml' book for example

  <b>@remove [true or false]</b>

    Removes an existing recipe that was added by vanilla Minecraft or other plugins/mods. 
    The recipe definition must have the exact ingredients of the recipe you want to overwrite.
    
    Results and smelt time will be ignored and you don't have to delete them if you want to keep them for later.
    
    If you don't know the exact ingredients you can use 'rmextract' command to extract all existing recipes in RecipeManager format.
    Value is optional, if value is not specified it will just be enabled.
    
    This can't be used along with @override flag.

    Using this flag more than once will overwrite the previous message.
    
    As 'item' argument you can define an item like in a result, material:data:amount.
    Or you can set the item as 'first' to use the first display result available, very useful for multiple results having @ingredientcondition flag on them.
    
    Optionally, using 'silentfail' argument you can make the recipe print no result if it wouldn't give anything in the case of no results being allowed to craft (by other flags, like @ingredientcondition).
    
    NOTE: If there is no item to be displayed (all are secret or unavailable), using this with 'first' will not do anything.
    NOTE: Can only be used on workbench recipes because it can not have effect on other recipes.

      extended               = (optional) Potion has extended duration
      splash                 = (optional) Throwable/breakable potion instead of drinkable
      lingering              = (optional) Lingering potion instead of drinkable
    
    
    Building a custom potion requires adding individual effects:
    
    A basic potion still affects the custom potion like the following:
    - If no basic potion is defined the bottle will look like 'water bottle' with no effects listed, effects still apply when drank
    - Basic potion's type affects bottle liquid color
    - Basic potion's splash still affects if the bottle is throwable instead of drinkable
    - Basic potion's extended and level do absolutely nothing.
    - The first custom effect added is the potion's name, rest of effects are in description (of course you can use @name to change the item name)
    
    Once you understand that, you may use @potion custom as many times to add as many effects you want.
    
    Similar syntax to basic effect, arguments separated by | character, can be in any order.
    Arguments for custom effect:
      type &lt;effect type&gt;  = (REQUIRED) Type of potion effect, read 'name index.html' at 'POTION EFFECT TYPE' section (not POTION TYPE!)
      duration &lt;float&gt;    = (optional) Duration of the potion effect in seconds, default 1 (does not work on HEAL and HARM)
      amplify &lt;number&gt;    = (optional) Amplify the effects of the potion, default 0 (e.g. 2 = &lt;PotionName&gt; III, numbers after potion's max level will display potion.potency.number instead)
      ambient             = (optional) Adds extra visual particles

    Setting to 'false' or 'remove' will disable the flag.

    <b>Examples:</b>
      @potionitem level max | type FIRE_RESISTANCE | extended // basic extended fire resistance potion
