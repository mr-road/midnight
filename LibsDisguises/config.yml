NotifyUpdate: true

# The disguise plugin stores all GameProfiles inside a file called 'cache.yml'

# However some people may prefer to disable this.
# Even if you disable this, if there was disguises in the cache already then it will use them

# As such, this completely replaces the KeepDisguises aspect which has been removed except for the player death.
# Players - Are player disguises saved
# Entities - Are entities disguises saved (This is everything that's not a player)
# If you are using the dev builds, place your premium version of Lib's Disguises.jar inside the LibsDisguises folder

# How should the plugin handle self disguises scoreboards? It disables pushing in whichever team they're assigned.
# If you want them to be able to push again when they undisguise, set this to CREATE_SCOREBOARD
# I have to disable pushing or you will be pushed around by your own self disguise
# MODIFY_SCOREBOARD - Modifies the player's current team if possible, otherwise assigns them to a new scoreboard team.
# IGNORE_SCOREBOARD - Doesn't touch scoreboards at all, effectively means that if you didn't disable pushing in their scoreboard team; They will still be pushed around
# CREATE_SCOREBOARD - Creates a new team which copies the attributes of their previous scoreboard team which they are then assigned to. This means they keep nametag color and other options.

# This shouldn't really be enabled for players as it also interferes with their movement because the server thinks the player is larger than he really is.
