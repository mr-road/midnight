################## Linkables #################

##You may disable any of these features by setting them to false
##You should disable all of these that you will not be using

##Using LootBags may cause lag if you have many items with a lot of lore on the server
LootBags: false
##If using LootBags, there is a security threat if players on your server are able to modify the lore of an item
##In that case, you should change this key to something else (such as &3&8&4&r&0) and keep it secret
LootBagKey: '&r&0'

##Using Dispensers may cause significant lag if you have a decent amount of redstone circuts on the server
##This also applies to Droppers
DispenserLoot: true

##Using MobLoot may cause significant lag if there are numerous mobs on the server
##e.g. Zombie, Creeper, Skeleton, Spider, Player
MobDropLoot: true
##e.g. ZombieSpawn, SkeletonSpawn, VillagerSpawn
MobSpawnLoot: true

##World Mob Loots should be disabled if you only have one World
##e.g. Zombie@MainWorld, Zombie@DungeonWorld
WorldMobDropLoot: true
##e.g. ZombieSpawn@MainWorld, ZombieSpawn@DungeonWorld
WorldMobSpawnLoot: true

##Region Mob Loots are automatically disabled if RegionOwn or WorldGuard is not installed
##e.g. Zombie@Graveyard, Spider@Nest
RegionMobDropLoot: true
RegionMobSpawnLoot: true

##Mob Types should be enabled if you want to distinguish between different types of Zombies, Skeletons, Villagers, etc.
##e.g. BabyZombie, WitherSkeleton, PriestVillager
MobTypes: true

##Named Mobs should be enabled if you want to have mobs drop loot based on their name
##e.g. ZombieBoss, Skeletor, Paul the Priest
NamedMobs: true

##Fishing Loot should be enabled to modify what Players can fish out of the water
##e.g. Fishing
FishingLoot: true

##Votifier Loot should be enabled to modify give Players loot whenever they Vote (Powered by Votifier)
##The Vote PhatLoot should be set to autoloot and give little loot to not cause issues with numerous votes at once
##e.g. Vote
VotifierLoot: false

##Only Block Materials that are listed below will be able to be linked
##Removing unused materials from this list will help reduce the use of uneeded resources
Blocks:
    - Chest
    - Trapped Chest
    - Ender Chest
    - Dispenser
    - Dropper
    - Bookshelf

##Every block in the specified Worlds that matches a listed Material will be linked to the given PhatLoot
##Blocks listed here need not be listed in 'Blocks' above
##I have commented out these default settings because noone bothers to read and replace them
##In order to set this feature you must remove the empty square brackets []
AutoLink: []
#    all:
#        Melon Block: melons
#    world:
#        Bookshelf: books



################## MOB LOOTS #################

##If set to true then the items normally dropped by mobs will vanish
##If set to false then Mob PhatLoot items will be in addition to the normally dropped loot
##In either case, a mob's loot will not be affected if it doesn't have a PhatLoot file
ReplaceMobLoot: true


##If set to true then Mobs will not drop any items/exp unless they are killed by a Player
OnlyDropLootWhenKilledByPlayer: false
OnlyDropExpWhenKilledByPlayer: false


##If Mobs spawn with items through this plugin, this is the chance that the item will be dropped (0 - 100)
MobLootDropPercentage: 20


##This setting is used when a weapon has the Looting enchantment
##Each level will give an extra percentage chance when rolling for loots
##e.g. LootingBonusPerLevel = 5
##     Zombies drop 1 rotten flesh 50% of the time
##     A zombie is killed with a sword that has Looting IV
##     1 rotten flesh would then be dropped at a 70% chance
##     50% + (5% x 4 levels)
LootingBonusPerLevel: 5

################## DEFAULTS ##################

##Each new PhatLoot will have the following settings by default
##Each of these settings can be changed per PhatLoot after they are made
Defaults:
    ##Amount of time before the PhatLoot is lootable again
    ##Change Days to -1 in order for it to never reset
    ResetTime:
        Days: 1
        Hours: 0
        Minutes: 0
        Seconds: 0


    ##If set to true, items will go straight to the looter's inventory
    ##Once their inventory is full, items will show up in the chest
    AutoLoot: false


    ##If set to true, when looted by one person, everyone must wait to loot it again (first person there gets the loot)
    ##If set to false, when a player loots a Chest only they must wait the specified time to loot again (everyone can have their share of loot)
    GlobalReset: false


    ##If set to true, when a global chest is looted, it will disappear and respawn when it may be looted again (or when the server is shutdown)
    #'UseBreakAndRespawn' must be set to true below in order for this to have any effect
    BreakAndRespawn: false


    ##If set to true, loot times will be rounded down to 0
    ##This is good if doing Daily or Hourly loots
    ##e.g.
    ##If ResetTime = 1 Day, 0 Hours, 0 Minutes, and 0 Seconds
    ##   RoundDownTime = true
    ##   Player loots at Day 100, Hour 20, Minute 37, and Second 49
    ##   Values that are 0 in the ResetTime are rounded down
    ##   The loot time is set to Day 100, Hour 0, Minute 0, and Second 0
    ##   This way, the Player can loot the next day even if it is not 24 hours later
    ##If ResetTime = 0 Day, 0 Hours, 5 Minutes, and 0 Seconds
    ##   then only the Seconds value is rounded down (not values to the left of Minutes)
    RoundDownTime: false


    ##The number of items that will be received from the loot collections (if not specified)
    ##An amount of 0 will mean that each loot within the collection is rolled for individually
    ItemsPerColl: 1
